I’m currently doing my Ph.D. in Design and Evaluation of Resistive-based Security Primitives, such as Physical Unclonable Functions and True Random Number Generators at TIMA Laboratory (Grenoble, France). I’m looking for ways to utilize emerging technologies to improve the security of hardware designs.

I am interested in open software, reproducible science, scientific visualization and art (generative art in particular).

Don't hesitate to reach me at servinagrero@gmail.com if you have any questions.
